&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi everyone!

&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't much of a game progress report, but this is instead me noting the occasion - The Conservatory's blog has been moved from my personal site to **my (new) business site**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Development of The Conservatory is unchanged. The only difference now is as follows:

1. I have this new domain, https://xansworkshop.com/
2. The game's repositories are now on a GitHub Organization that I own.

&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's it. Hopefully you like the new website, it fits in with Xan (the character)'s thematic cues and I think it looks awesome. I'll have more to say about the game's development soonish - pinky promise!
