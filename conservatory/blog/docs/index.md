# The Conservatory Development Blog

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello! Welcome to **The Conservatory Development Blog**! Here, I post chronological updates on my progress through the game's development. I also host peeks into the lore of the game's universe. Go explore!

## What is *The Conservatory?*

&nbsp;&nbsp;You can learn about the game and my main reason for wanting to create it on the sidebar, here: [What is *The Conservatory?*](./about.md)

## How can I stay up to date?

&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage you to join [the Discord server](
https://discord.gg/pt7VQqagyE)! Here, I post updates (including new blog posts), and occasionally will **livestream the development of my game.** You can also ask questions about it here.

## Where do I read?

&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest blog post was uploaded on [2 September 2025: *Mod Code Safety, Inventories (again), Lore*](./2025/09/02.md). You can find it and other entries on the left side of the page, under the Blog category.

## How do I make mods? Where's the code documentation?

&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are looking for the modding tutorials, visit <del>[The Modder's Guide](../../docs/index.html)</del> (this link has been temporarily 404'd because it's too early in development).
