# The Conservatory Development Blog

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello! My name is Xan. Here, I post chronological updates about the development of my game. These blog posts were originally hosted solely on [the Discord](
https://discord.gg/YGJ7a44UEE) but I have since moved them here to make them publicly accessible.

&nbsp;&nbsp;This site is powered by `mkdocs-material` and is what I will (or do, depending on when you are reading this) use for official documentation.

## What is *The Conservatory?*

&nbsp;&nbsp;You can learn about the game and my main reason for wanting to create it on the sidebar, here: [What is *The Conservatory?*](./about.md)

## Where do I read?

&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest blog post was uploaded on [1 January 2025: *The Conservatory Analysis Tools*](./2025/01/01.md). You can find it and other entries on the left side of the page, under the Blog category.

## How do I make mods? Where's the code documentation?

&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are looking for the modding tutorials, visit <del>[The Modder's Guide](../../docs/index.html)</del> (this link has been temporarily 404'd because it's too early in development).
