## Overview

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaians are descendants of the *Human* species of the planet *Earth*. They are responsible for the foundation of the *[Interstellar Sapience Congruity Accord (ISCA)](../other-lore/isca.md)* and are much more docile and unified than their ancestors. They are mostly bald, endoskeletal bipeds, which exhibit particularly high intelligence.

## Phenotype

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaian anatomy is effectively the same as Human anatomy with a few changes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaians still have two primary types of hair, vellus (the thin, almost invisible kind that covers their entire body) and terminal (the large, thicker, visible hair, such as that on their legs, face, or head). Hair colors are typically brown in shade, with varying lightness, ranging from bright colors like pale gray, to dark colors like brown or black. Orange hair, which was a rare trait in some Humans, was not passed down to Gaians.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaian eyes follow typical Human eye colors (green, brown, black, hazel, blue) but a mutation has caused rare occurrences of bright gray to occur. The sclera still remains completely white, and their pupils round. Unfortunately, there are no known natural Gaians who have 20:20 eyesight; the distribution among individuals with refractive error still remains roughly the same as it was with Humans, with a majority of individuals being nearsighted. Technology is often used to correct eyesight however, so eyeglasses are not common, considered to be more of a fashion statement rather than a useful tool.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaian appendages still follow the standard vertibrate model, with four fingers and a thumb. Gaian feet have evolved to discard their four smaller toes, though the bone structure still remains the same, giving their feet a "sock in a sandal" look. Height remains relatively the same as their predecessors, with an average height of 1.5m.

&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gaian respiratory system is still the same, with two lungs which perform respiration through capillaries in the alveoli. The trachea is connected to the upper esophagus, and much like their predecessors, they are occasionally prone to inhaling food and drink as a result of their significantly shifted larynx (voice box).

&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gaian digestive system is also largely the same, however they do not have genetic disorders like diabetes in their genone. Additionally, Gaians still have an intestinal microbiome, but it has changed fairly significantly, with a stronger dependence on microbes for processing. It has changed so much in fact, that gaians have discussed the topic of being classified as symbiotes in the near evolutionary future as a very real possibility.
