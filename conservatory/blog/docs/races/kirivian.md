## Overview

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kirivians are furred bipeds who primarily live nomadic lives in the stars. They are often compared to cats due to a number of similarities in facial structure to Gaian feline species. They are highly social and extremely welcoming to their peers, strangers and family alike. It is a level of unity unseen in other races, and stands out as an oddity compared to other races in the [ISCA](../other-lore/isca.md).

### Phenotype

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kirivians tend to have fur lengths ranging from 2cm to 5cm depending on genetics. They often have two coats of fur of different colors. The coats tend to be Silver, Gunmetal, Orange, Dusty Red, Brown, Gold, or White.

&nbsp;&nbsp;They have two eyes with round pupils. They do not have an iris, and instead the sclera of their eye is colored. Typical colors are Green, Yellow, Blue, and Orange.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Their appendages are bipedal in nature, but unlike Gaians they only have three fingers and a thumb instead of four. Their fingers are also composed of only two joints rather than three. Unlike the cats they are often compared to, they do not have claws. Their legs are digitigrade-like, with a distinct three-segment build. Curiously, they are hooved, and do not have paws on their feet like one might expect. The hooves are not split, and are shaped somewhat like hockey pucks.

&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kirivian digestive system is effectively identical to that of most mammals on Gaia, functionally. They do not have organs like the pancreas and gall bladder, as these enzymes are generated naturally within their stomachs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kirivian respiratory system is also identical to most mammals on Earth, with two lungs. Unlike mammals, their trachea does not share space with their esophagus, and instead their mouth only goes to their stomach, their noses only go into their lungs.
