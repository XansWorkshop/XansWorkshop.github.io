## Overview

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kirivians are furred bipeds who exist in nomadic tribes, often compared to cats due to a number of similarities in facial structure to Gaian domesticated feline species. They are highly social and extremely welcoming to their peers, strangers and family alike. It is a level of unity unseen in other races, and stands out as an oddity compared to other races in the [ISCA](../other-lore/isca.md).

### Phenotype

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kirivians tend to have fur lengths ranging from 2cm to 5cm depending on genetics. They often have two coats of fur of different colors. The coats tend to be Silver, Gunmetal, Orange, Dusty Red, Brown, Gold, or White.

&nbsp;&nbsp;They have two eyes with round pupils. They do not have an iris, and instead the sclera of their eye is colored. Typical colors are Green, Yellow, Blue, and Orange.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Their appendages are bipedal in nature, but unlike Gaians they only have three fingers and a thumb instead of four. Their fingers are also composed of only two joints rather than three. Unlike the cats they are often compared to, they do not have claws. Their legs are digitigrade-like, with a distinct three-segment build. Curiously, they are hooved, and do not have paws on their feet like one might expect. The hooves are not split, and are shaped somewhat like hockey pucks.

&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kirivian digestive system is effectively identical to that of most mammals on Gaia, functionally. They do not have organs like the pancreas and gall bladder, as these enzymes are generated naturally within their stomachs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kirivian respiratory system is also identical to most mammals on Earth, with two lungs. Unlike mammals, their trachea does not share space with their esophagus, and instead their mouth only goes to their stomach, their noses only go into their lungs.

## Home World

&nbsp;&nbsp;Their home world, Numala, is in a particularly interesting state. It is currently in the process of recovering from an ecological disaster. A coronal mass ejection from their star directly hit their home planet, destroying its magnetic field. Most of the world's oceans and atmosphere were removed by solar winds, turning the planet into a desert comprised from the sand that was once the ocean floor. Plant life could not sustain itself under the harsh radiation of the star, and was quick to die, as were most animals that fed on the plants. The only life to survive was the fungi, which commonly resided in caves or places otherwise protected from solar radiation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;The most intriguing part of their planet is its water cycle. The current state of the world causes there to be a perpetual, though thin, cloud cover over all of its skies. It is constantly around 80% relative humidity, yet rain is extremely rare. From space, the planet looks like a shiny glass ball, but from within, an even more beautiful wavy sky with sun rays peeking through thinner sections of the cloud layer exists, almost in a manner similar to looking up through the surface of water.

&nbsp;&nbsp;In place of the now extinct plant life, photosynthesizing fungi dominate the world, primarily growing on what is left of the elevated land masses. Unlike earth fungi, these have not evolved for aggressive growth strategies, and thus remain relatively isolated. The fungi are somewhat toxic, but are often harvested and cultivated for dye and processed into safe food due to their beautiful red, violet, blue, and green pigments and otherwise nutritious properties.

## Culture and Standards

### *The Day of Clear Skies*

&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite their technological advancements, Kirivians still prefer tribal life. They exhibit a rather unique behavior in that they have only a couple dozen cities on the world, and these cities do not contain residencies. Instead, a city is seen more as a tool, with publicly usable stations and booths where travelers and visitors can temporarily run businesses and commune with their peers. Culturally, staying in any one place is seen as an oddity that previously held a connotation of bad luck, but which has become more and more normal especially with their membership in the ISCA.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Every solar cycle, over the span of a couple days, the alignment of the world rotates to a point where their star aims through a very specific weak spot in the planet's recovering magnetic field. The current makeup of the field is just thin enough to where at this precise angle, radiation has a chance of falling through, blowing the clouds out of the way. This event is celebrated and festivals are held across the globe, as it is the only time in the year where the sky is visible. At dawn and dusk, the people observe beautiful auroras, and at night they can see the stars in the sky. Outside races tend to playfully call this event "the cat's eye" when viewed from space, as the star cuts a distinctive slit-shaped path through the clouds, though it is officially known as *The Day of Clear Skies.*

### Fashion

Kirivians love thick, woven cloth formed from mycelia fibers. Typically, cloth is decorated around its edges with repeating patterns (occasionally meander, often basic geometric shapes). Little decorations and drawings of this nature that do not take up a significant focal point of the piece are very common. Most cloth is given a pale color, typically blue, red, orange, yellow, brown, violet, and green.

Despite industrialization, most cloth is still handmade as a cultural statement, and most stitches are formed from very thin ropes rather than threads.

### Romantic and Bonding Interests

&nbsp;&nbsp;Kirivians tend to form relationships with their peers in discrete groups of defined sizes that are considered culturally normal. These groups may be a monogomanous relationship of two individuals, or a polyamorous relationship of three or four individuals. Other numbers tend to be considered strange, but are not shunned in society. Most average individuals which are interested in life with a companion have one or two others.

&nbsp;&nbsp;When two individuals come together, there is surprisingly no large-scale ceremony for a civil union (think Marriage). Instead, relationships are localized to their direct families in line with their nomadic lifestyles, and typically involve a feast. Other activities are typically up to the ones getting unified and tend to fall in line with their personalities and interests; they can range from nothing at all to games and dances for the whole day.

!!! danger "A part of this document has been omitted."
    Certain parts of the specification (specifically for how this race is designed anatomically) contains mature content which has no means of being age-gated at this time. Until further notice, the section will be largely cleared to prevent this content from being visible to possible underage visitors.

&nbsp;&nbsp;They have children like mammals. I really just want cat people with some weird alien quirks but this can be normal.

[^disp:&#x5B;Anomaly&#x20;1&#x5D;]: Star is a black hole star. Its radius has been compressed and its composition matches that of a main sequence star, but the energy released is enormous, as shown in its anomalous luminosity. The star is expected to live only a few hundred million years longer.
