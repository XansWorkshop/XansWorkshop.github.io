## Overview

!!! note "This document flat out isn't done."
    So here, you can have the moodboard / themes instead.

Avelian are the avian race, bird people are cool. They are themed after very idealized-victorian lifestyles and so they really, *really* love the arts, expressions of the self, being posh and rich (but not as greedy), and highly value their technological advancements.

A huge inspiration was the Avians from Starbound aesthetically, though less focus on being an analogue to Egyptians and more European.

These are being written by my best friend and co-author RWGryphon hence why most of the data is missing (and if you are seeing this, gryph, no. you are not behind. you do not need to stress about this. this is not an embarassment. you have time. everybody undertstands this.)
