&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I am excited to announce that I have just been given permission by *LawnReality* to use a very large majority of his music in my game!

&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm an indie developer, so I don't have a budget, especially one to pay a musician for a full soundtrack. While my very best friend *RWGryphon* has generously allowed me to use his music (especially since he helps me with the lore), having LawnReality's absolute arsenal of fantasy/sci-fi music is literally the perfect match for this game which is of the same genre.

&nbsp;&nbsp;**I will say, you probably already know his music without realizing it.** His music was largely popularized just upwards of a decade ago (wow) when a few folks on Roblox made use of it. In particular, you may be familiar with [Fading Memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oq8xTRgcOiE).

&nbsp;&nbsp;I always jokingly describe him as *"the CEO of the OC music that played in your head when you were 9 years old"*, because that's basically it. The furries reading this today know exactly what I am talking about. Autism wavelengths are overpowered man.

&nbsp;&nbsp;When I describe it as his "absolute arsenal" of music, I mean it. 444 tracks(!)
