&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time I used to use *010 Editor*. It's a hex editor with the ability to use patterns, that is, map out structs in the file and display them in a neat little data tree.

&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing is, this app costs money. Admittedly I realized I was a bit of a schmuck when my buddy told me about the vastly superior [ImHex](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex), a FOSS alternative.

&nbsp;&nbsp;**For this reason, all included mappings of game data now use the `*.hexpat` format for ImHex, rather than 010 Editor's `*.bt` format.** This brings me to the next point: **All file types used by the game come with data mappings so you can open files (like world data files, your save file, and etc.) to directly see the data in the file.** No need to map it out yourself.
