&nbsp;&nbsp;I went on a bit of a hiatus for a while as I focused on other stuff.

&nbsp;&nbsp;This one is short: Remember that old lighting bug when I added pixel shadows? The one where it created weird triangle artifacts? **That bug is no more!**

&nbsp;&nbsp;With some fancy math (creating a 3x3 rotation matrix from the normal, binormal, and tangent vectors of the face being rendered) I was able to properly rotate the shadow projection in 3D space to align it to the surface.

&nbsp;&nbsp;If that makes zero sense to you, here's a before/after that should make more sense:

![The before image. The shadow should exist in discrete squares along the pink surface, but the squares are distorted and have strange, nonsensical angles.](./img/bugged.png){width=49%}
![The after image. The squares of the shadow now align to match the angle of the pink surface they are being cast upon.](./img/fixed.png){width=49%}
