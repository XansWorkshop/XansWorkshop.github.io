&nbsp;&nbsp;The *Interstellar Sapience Congruity Accord* (ISCA) is a governmental body created by the [Gaians](../races/gaian.md), [Avelians](../races/avelian.md), and [Kirivians](../races/kirivian.md). It serves as a means of creating a peaceful unity with other beings in the universe, and grants well-defined rights to these beings regardless of membership.

&nbsp;&nbsp;The ISCA strives to be as accessible as possible to all species. Membership is relatively easy to attain, with the following being the most significant of the requirements:

* Member governments must uphold the values of the ISCA, and must enforce that their citizens do not undermine its values.
* Members must enforce all ISCA rights and cannot rescind them or create exceptions under any circumstances.
    * All ISCA officials above the rank of (not yet defined) have the ability to unilaterally approve or deny political asylum across the entire organization.
* Members do not need a dedicated homeworld, only an organized and stable government.

## History

!!! tip "Not well defined!"
    This section is not well defined due to the fluid nature of the lore in the game's current state.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, the ISCA was the "XGRF" (Cross-Galactic Research Foundation), owned only by the Kirivans and Avelians. The Gaians, being from half way across the galaxy, were the catalyst that turned it into something greater. When it became obvious to them that these newly-arrived Gaians were a significantly more docile people compared to their ancestors (the Humans), and moreover that they needed to be ready to account for new species, all three races found themselves in agreement: the ISCA was the most reasonable next step to take in the development of their collective cultures.

### Neural Translator

&nbsp;&nbsp;One crucial piece of technology for the ISCA is the *Neural Translator*. This is an advanced, implantable neural network designed to recognize patterns in language to form reliable translations in real-time. Everybody speaks their own language, and everybody else understands. It is also equipped to understand new languages in as little time as possible.

## Fan Content and Mods

&nbsp;&nbsp;Understandably, a lot of people who interact with this game are the kind of people who love to make fan content. **Here is me telling you that you *are allowed (and encouraged) to make your own species be members, allies, or enemies to, the ISCA*.** Seriously, go right ahead! I love it when people feel like they can integrate and be a part of my story. I very intentionally left it open ended and easy to get in for this exact purpose. I *want* your creative little self-inserts and fanons!

&nbsp;&nbsp;For example...

&nbsp;&nbsp;A small part of the *Avali* community has shown an interest in the game. For this reason, I gave my thanks in the form of allowing Scratch to be used in-game. Additionally, some stuff such as the ability for a `Species` object in game code to declare native temperatures/pressures that are survivable came from realizing someone might want to mod it in.

&nbsp;&nbsp;And...

&nbsp;&nbsp;My request to use *Akolouthos* (often just called *"Ako"*) in-game was accepted. This is something used in *Antiheat's* universe (which I mark as a source of inspiration over on [the About page](../about.md)). This one is particularly interesting; it is a vertical typeface designed for use by synethetic (robotic) races. It can still be read manually if you know the symbols. Typically, typed phrases do their best to remain square. Each glyph is square as well. This is a 4x4, with two characters overflowing to the right:

<center><span class="ako">HELLO, SYNTHETICS.</span><br/><small>"Hello, Synthetics."</small></center>
<center><span class="ako" style="font-family:Fairfax HD;text-align: left;">HELLO, SYNTHETICS.</span><br/><small>This way â†’</small></center>
<br/>
<center><span class="ako">I actually really like this mode of writing, because it just looks like a proper datablock. It almost intuitively feels like something that is easily usable for robotic species, hence why I was so excited to try to use it.</span><br/><small>"I actually really like this mode of writing, because it just looks like a proper datablock.
