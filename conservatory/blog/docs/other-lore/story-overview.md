# Overview

!!! danger "Nothing on this page is a promised feature or guaranteed to be in the game."
    If you are seeing this warning bubble, here is a reminder that **this project is in early development.**<br/>
    <br/>
    <span style="color:#faa">**Anything you see here is *NOT* a promise or guarantee. Features on this page *WILL BE ADDED, REMOVED, OR CHANGED WITHOUT ANY SORT OF NOTICE.***</span> If I find you on twitter.com saying how I "broke promises" because you saw something on this page that I removed later, I will point at you and laugh for being a dummy idiot doodoo bref dummy head, a real stinker, perhaps dare I say, a poopyhead even.

***

&nbsp;&nbsp;For obvious reasons, **I will not be telling you the plot outline verbatim.** Not only is it subject to change as mentioned above, but it's also fairly internal right now! So while this may be what is on my storyboard, it may not be what happens in game.

## Exposition

&nbsp;&nbsp;The player begins the game in what seems to be a dream or a daze. They are in some facility, there's alarms blaring, things are up in flames, but there's nobody there! Fire suppression seems to be failing or missing, and the player can't help but to notice a sigil drawn repeatedly all over the walls, ceiling, and floor.

&nbsp;&nbsp;The player has to find an escape, running through a set of halls that aren't (yet) on fire. As they move on, strange distortions seem to be occurring in reality itself, as if someone is trying to rip apart the fabric of spacetime. Ultimately, the player will be led around the maze of hallways with no way out, only to get caught in an explosion and thrown into a rift.

&nbsp;&nbsp;The player wakes up on the surface of the planet, their crashed ship nearby. Its basely functioning nav system reports that this region of space is not known, and no starcharts match. The player is lost, alone, and stranded.

## The Goal

&nbsp;&nbsp;The player's first goal is to survive, and find clues to what might have happened to them. We love a good mystery!
