### Special Thanks

**Mom and Dad**<br/>
Thanks for letting me stick around while I work on this.


**Darrell Flood**<br/>
I use some of your fonts in my game. I bought them in your itch.io fire sale.


**Ben Golus**<br/>
Resident GPU Wizard. You mostly helped people in Unity but every time I had some weird shader issue or wondered how to do something / if something was a good idea, you were there in the replies with genuinely amazing advice.


**Kiavich**<br/>
One of the little title themes, named "Iterators". It's good.

**Tundr**<br/>
You suggested the original name for the *Avelians*, back when they were called *Balaur*. Sorry it didn't stick.
