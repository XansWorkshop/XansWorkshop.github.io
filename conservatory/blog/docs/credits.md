## Credits: Key People

&nbsp;&nbsp;People who helped, but not actively. Stuff like one-off helpers.

### LawnReality

&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy writes publicly usable music for free, which is awesome. You've probably heard his music somewhere. Not as widespread as someone like *Kevin MacLeod*. Definitely a bit more of an underdog, I think his most popular song has somehting like 70k views on YouTube as of writing?

* Music (General Background, Misc.)
    * There's 400+ tracks available in his selection. I am not listing them.
