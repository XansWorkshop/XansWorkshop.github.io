It's a good read if you really want the extra detail, but if you just want to figure out what the game is (as in, what it's like to play, what it'll have in it), skip this section!</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0My name is Xan (\"Zan\", rhymes with \"Sam\"). The Conservatory is partly a love-letter, and partly an attempt to build upon, a very specific genre of game I both love and want to see more of.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0If there's one thing you should know about me, it's that I love media that focuses on the evocation of feelings, I love worldbuilding. I love it when my worlds feel alive, when they have substance, when you can interact with them. I have been writing stories since I was a little kid, and indeed Xan is actually my first persona. He is almost as old as me.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0The Conservatory is not only an attempt to grow upon genres I like, but it's also a game for me personally. There's a game I have always wanted to play, but which does not exist. The exact feeling I aim to capture is a level of immersion that feels open. That is, I don't believe a one man army is good enough to beat the best of the best when it comes to making immersive games. I do believe that I have the ability to create a system which facilitates this type of interaction with the players, however, and I hope to achieve exactly that.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0 You see, I want a world that acknowledges who the player is. But vitally, I don't want it to be all serious and bureaucratic. We need to have fun. If I'm going to have a space station, I want niche and borderline comical accommodations for random races. I want multilingual boards in alien languages and codeblocks for synthetics.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0I want to see the world morphed to fit the people that visit it most regularly.</p>"},{"location":"about/#sources-of-inspiration","title":"Sources of Inspiration","text":"<p>\u00a0\u00a0If you are in this list, consider yourself honored, at least by me!

For average Joe, the takeaway here is that you can imagine most players as a member of some selected species, a bit like aliens in a sci-fi universe.<ul> <li>Everybody is their own thing, but typically based on something real or made up and shared by many others, and so there is uniformity in groups of people. These common species are often called \"avatar bases\", as they serve as a common \"base\" for people to customize their avatars. So if you see me using that term, \"avatar base\", think species or race.</li> <li>This is useful because a significant amount of the worlds linked below play on this fact.</li> <li>You do not need to find a special avatar to visit these worlds. You can visit in anything, default avatar included. Just jump in!</li> <li>It is worth it to note that in VR social games like this, the body people use is significantly closer to the sense of self for the user, so while in a typical PC game such strong emphasis on your character may not be important, in VR it is especially important for some people. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, the worlds:</p> <ul> <li>Qoo H. Bocuma International Airport, The Pact, and Hokyl Night by hdorriker, DekaWolf, and Fraxul (collectively). These three worlds take place in one universe. This captures a certain lighthearted attitude about sci-fi worlds that I wish wasn't so rare. I'm not going to lie to you, I'm pretty tired of the crisp, perfected future species, but I'm also tired of the grunge criminal-run megacities. I want something funny in my bowl of future. Why's it always super clean or super filthy?<ul> <li>Qoo H. Bocuma International Airport covers both international and interstellar travel. It contains hilarious gags for specific families of avatar bases, and a bunch of jokes for the tight knit and the public alike. You can also ride the (sentient) baggage system. Eurobeat included for the carts.</li> <li>Hokyl Night is the city that the airport is in. And when I say \"the city\", I mean \"the city\". The whole thing. Like you get floating point rounding error artifacts near its borders (thanks Unity). It's the whole city.</li> <li>The Pact is an embassy for the races that make up the universe, and it's a treasure trove of the little jokes and hilariously creative humor that scratches the sci-fi itch. Bureaucracy is so boring. That's why they host office kickball tournaments with varyingly possibly-ill-ideologically promotional posters, of course!</li> <li>It's worth it to mention that while humor is a huge part of these worlds, they are still serious! It's a bit like Hitchhiker's Guide with its humor, in that the world is coherent and has legitimate things, but they aren't afraid to put a promotional poster that says \"Do you hate pooping?\" right next to a travel ad (I am not joking).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Wild Flower \uff5c \u91ce\u306e\u82b1 , Nest \u30cd\u30b9\u30c8, and I N I T I U M\u00a0 \u2044\u2044\u2044 \u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb by Artsy Glitch. These worlds also share a universe (*as far as I can tell). They have a particular artstyle that definitely influenced my style for Kirivian architecture. It's this weirdly relaxing mixture of refurbished post-apocalyptic bunker x solarpunk. Honestly the feelings that this set of worlds evokes are too difficult to describe with words, in particular I urge you to visit these yourself.<ul> <li>Wild Flower \uff5c \u91ce\u306e\u82b1 is a somewhat large bunker with varying living accomodations ranging from antique furniture to neo-material furniture that just screams \"space age\" to me. It has a TV, botanical observatory, indoor firepit, and a bedroom. I'm not trying to sell you a house, pinky promise.</li> <li>Nest \u30cd\u30b9\u30c8 is another decked out bunker, but this time it's single room, intended to be made your VR home world in all likelihood. Very cozy, same aesthetic as the previous world, but far more personable.</li> <li>I N I T I U M\u00a0 \u2044\u2044\u2044 \u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb is an interesting world whose lore is not entirely clear. It seems to be taking care of(?) some strange tree which is closely related to evangelical occurrences? They do seem to have frames for futuristic angels laying around, which is pretty sick.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Antiheat's Apartment by Antiheat (who woulda thunk) is, despite the name, an entire city rather than just the apartment within that city. Antiheat's universe here intermingles with that created by hdorriker et. al., and captures a slightly-more-serious tone. It's one of your more typical sci-fi worlds, but it has a feel to it that I really like knowing it's an extension of a universe I already really love.</li> <li>Furality Sylva: Treehouse Village by Furality Team is a virtual convention world. This one was a huge, huge source of inspiration for the style of the Kirivian people rather than their architecture. This perfectly captures that nomadic vibe. I am very thankful that the team uploads archives of previous years' conventions for public access.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/#film","title":"Film","text":"<p>\u00a0\u00a0I'm not much of a TV/Movie guy so this will be considerably smaller, but of those that I have watched, some of them have managed to weasel their way into my writing.</p> <ul> <li>Star Trek: The Next Generation is basically the only TV series that I have actively tried to watch the entirety of.

I'm one of those diehard fans that will tell you the game was better in 2015, but the core of the game is the same. You build your own robot and you fight other players with it.

You have probably seen it from time to time especially in older programs, \"You need to install .NET Framework for this!\" or whatever else.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0In the archaic past, we actually had three .NETs:</p> <ol> <li>.NET Framework, which was a windows-focused specialized toolkit designed for making desktop applications.</li> <li>.NET Core, which was a cross-platform generalized toolkit where you could write code once and have it work on every OS. It could also write web applications and a few other doohickeys that I won't get into</li> <li>.NET Standard, which is basically Core's older brother. Standard stopped after 2.0 and Core took over from there.</li> </ol> <p>\u00a0\u00a0Both of these could mostly do the same thing if you ignored the platform specialization, but they were very different.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0After these two coexisted for a long time, Microsoft realized the problem and was like \"we can't keep maintaining two of the same thing\". This was a hurdle because .NET Framework ended on version 4.8, but .NET Core ended on version 3.1, and they both had their specialties. They needed to merge them together, though.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0What they ended up doing was siding with .NET Core (a good choice, I think, because it was the one that worked on all platforms).</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0Remember how I brought up the version numbers? That was a small problem for the new unified system, which is called \".NET\" - plain, no word after it. Just \".NET\". So if you ever see me say that without \"Framework\" or \"Core\" after it, I mean the new unified one. Ok?</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0So - .NET began on version ... 5! Yes, the first release was version 5. This might sound really weird, but honestly it was kind of genius to stop even more confusion from adding up. People would likely download Core or Framework if it started on 1 because they would see the bigger version numbers of Framework/Core and go \"oh, those must be newer\", when that is not in fact true.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0Thankfully, after .NET 5 dropped, things got way less confusing. It's actually quite elegant! Namely:</p> <ul> <li>Every year, a new .NET releases. They are currently about to release .NET 9, The Conservatory uses .NET 8.</li> <li>Every even version number (6, 8, ...) is \"Long-Term Support\", or LTS for short. It stays supported for longer than the odd releases.</li> </ul> <p>But we are talking about Roslyn Analyzers in this blog post.

It works, sort of. It's by far the most fucked up solution I think I have ever seen. But it works. Sort of.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0The issue is that the runtime exists in a discrete state. It's a runtime, so it tries to do what it would do on a normal computer and load the code into its own little bubble. This means that the code existed in this weird limbo state where it was technically loaded by .NET standard but only sort of, and the real thing still lived in the Framework bubble. I could access those parts of the code but I had to use a weird shared memory page hack and it was a disaster. I don't even want to articulate how hilariously hacky it was.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0Later in the future I'll probably try it again in a more sane way, but that means I have to develop two apps together instead of just one.

Originally I was chugging along forward with the data structure and moving ahead until I started implementing character physics.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0So to recap (and introduce some new information):</p> <ul> <li>I had the idea of using <code>CharacterBody3D</code> as my collider type for bones due to the existence of <code>move_and_slide()</code> provided by the engine. This method simulates physics for characters and is specifically designed for this one purpose.</li> <li>I now use <code>AnimatableBody3D</code> which is effectively the same, but it derives from <code>StaticBody3D</code> which allows for some better handling due to trimming out a lot of behavior that is not necessary. It also has a similar but distinctly different <code>move_and_collide()</code> method which does roughly the same thing.</li> </ul> <p>\u00a0\u00a0And now, a story.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0This is the story of a developer named Xan. Xan was about to write physics simulation code for character models, something he was very excited to work on, something where the path ahead was so clear he knew precisely what had to be done to achieve his goal.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0That was, until the time to write the code came along. \"Let's use this built in method to simulate motion with other physics objects,\" he said.

This describes the direction the object is moving, and how fast. But something was missing...</p> <p> \"Hm, that's odd,\" he says to himself. \"Where is the angular velocity parameter?\" he wondered aloud.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0Xan was soon to discover that there was not, in fact, an angular velocity parameter.</p>"},{"location":"2024/11/24/#what-happens-now","title":"What Happens Now?","text":"<p>\u00a0\u00a0Ordinarily this would not matter so much, typically objects just apply their rotation first then simulate motion. It's not technically correct but for 99% of cases - especially with respect to characters which are not typically spinning - it is fine. With bones, however, there's a fundamental problem with this: Bones are constrained by rotating joints. Bones don't move and slide. They rotate.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0To simulate characters, bones need to be able to spin which the physics simulator doesn't support on any type except <code>RigidBody3D</code>, which is not kinematic.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0So you know how mass is just a number kind of like weight?

I will say now for those wondering, I am not implementing true correct physics simulations. Instead I am just moving a bit and checking iteratively (so more like SM64's quartersteps for rotation, and its 1/16th steps, and to optimize, rotation simulations are clamped to 360 degrees so comically fast rotation speeds aren't going to break it.

This could be an NPC, a machine, or a vehicle. Blocks in the world are not entities, because they are just geometry. That should make sense, right?</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0Most games have a distinct entity type for the player. This is incredibly common as it allows assigning special functionality to players that NPCs wouldn't typically have, like a link to the save file, an inventory, and other assorted goodies. It also makes it easy for NPCs to know that they are interacting with a player. You see, I actually chose to not do this.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0In my game, entities have a piece of data known as an input provider. This is basically the interface layer that links some arbitrary technique of control to the entity. This control could be an AI (like, the traditional game kind, not deep learning), or it could be your keyboard+mouse/gamepad. What matters is that it provides instructions for what the entity should be doing.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0By extension of this, players are identified with the player controller. Consider this and the lack of a specific player entity type, and you (hopefully) guessed it: the player can be any (living) entity in the game! The game is designed with this in mind. And modders, don't worry, there is a very convenient, well-defined <code>AbstractEntity.IsPlayer</code> property available to you.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0I think this opens the door for a lot of potential with new gameplay created by users. This was heavily inspired by Risk of Rain 2's <code>RoR2::CharacterBody</code> class. You can actually play as anything in the game, not just the survivors, and I thought that was really cool. It was also inspired by Rain World's Safari Mode, where you can take control of random creatures around the map and play with the ecosystem.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0Most importantly, I think this is an outstanding immersive tool. Games often treat the player differently, and it kind of breaks the immersion if your goal is to tell your own story where you might not want to be the flashy main character.

If it is an action and, discretely, is not movement (because movement and jumping has its own system), and is not an interaction with a usable object (because interactions have their own type as well, but this may very well change!) it's an Entity Action.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0Actions are entirely arbitrary, and must be created on game startup (you can't create new action types during runtime (read: after mod initialization), this is for network compatibility and such). The thing is, an entity has to know what actions it can actually do, and these actions might change depending on context! For example, a person's default primary action might be to swing their fist, but if they are holding a gun, it needs to override the primary action so they shoot the gun instead of swinging it at someone.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0To do this, there is a container type: An action palette. This holds a number of predefined action slots (primary, secondary, tertiary, that sort) that can be stored. These palettes are applied to a species to declare their default actions, then can be applied to items to override certain slots using a priority system.

When they do this, they (used to?) seek the community for artists willing to give up their designs to the game in exchange for a payment.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0Kaviki was one of the artists that wanted to try to shoot their shot and get their design into the game. It was ultimately not selected. Now the thing is, I had actually not seen Kaviki's design until after the selection was made, and as horrible as it might be for me to say this, I am actually glad it wasn't selected.</p> <p> </p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0You see, at the time I saw it, I was going through a bit of an identity crisis, riddled with mental complications and depression, still rebuilding myself after past drama. I had an idealized image of myself, this blank, expressionless thing. A feeling, an idea... And then Kaviki's design was thrown into my DMs by a friend who still played the game. It didn't even take a second, I looked at it, and said \"That's the one\". Actually, that doesn't do my reaction justice. It was so perfect to me that I made the original Conservator model (shown in the four pictures above) in less than a day. That's how significant it was to me. I have both ADHD and autism, so my focus is ordinarily terrible. You can connect the dots by now I am sure.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0I am cutting out a huge chunk of detail, but the important part is the end result after I had help finding the artist to contact them. We had talked, and eventually I paid for the adoption of this design. It became, properly, mine. Even though The Conservator right now is not very similar to the original design (save for its body profile), it would be horrible of me to not put a shoutout to Kaviki here. If you are reading this, here is yet another thank you, and a reminder for just how important your design is to me.</p>"},{"location":"other-lore/characters/librarian/","title":"The Librarian","text":"<p>Nothing on this page is a promised feature or guaranteed to be in the game.</p> <p>If you are seeing this warning bubble, here is a reminder that this project is in early development.</p> <p>Content you see here is in a constant state of change.

Hair colors are typically brown in shade, with varying lightness, ranging from bright colors like pale gray, to dark colors like brown or black. Orange hair, which was a rare trait in some Humans, was not passed down to Gaians.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gaian eyes follow typical Human eye colors (green, brown, black, hazel, blue) but a mutation has caused rare occurrences of bright gray to occur. The sclera still remains completely white, and their pupils round. Unfortunately, there are no known natural Gaians who have 20:20 eyesight; the distribution among individuals with refractive error still remains roughly the same as it was with Humans, with a majority of individuals being nearsighted. Technology is often used to correct eyesight however, so eyeglasses are not common, considered to be more of a fashion statement rather than a useful tool.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gaian appendages still follow the standard vertibrate model, with four fingers and a thumb. Gaian feet have evolved to discard their four smaller toes, though the bone structure still remains the same, giving their feet a \"sock in a sandal\" look. Height remains relatively the same as their predecessors, with an average height of 1.5m.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Gaian respiratory system is still the same, with two lungs which perform respiration through capillaries in the alveoli. The trachea is connected to the upper esophagus, and much like their predecessors, they are occasionally prone to inhaling food and drink as a result of their significantly shifted larynx (voice box).</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Gaian digestive system is also largely the same, however they do not have genetic disorders like diabetes in their genone. Additionally, Gaians still have an intestinal microbiome, but it has changed fairly significantly, with a stronger dependence on microbes for processing. It has changed so much in fact, that gaians have discussed the topic of being classified as symbiotes in the near evolutionary future as a very real possibility.</p>"},{"location":"races/gaian/#home-world","title":"Home World","text":"<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gaia is a lush, partially terraformed, partially natural planet.

Earth was once a lush world much like their current home of Gaia, but was destroyed due to careless overindustrialization from people in positions of power who refused to - or were incapable of - listening to reason. It is often mentioned that a prior trait of Humans was the emergence of sociopathic traits within some individuals in large communities, who often abused their community's goodwill to get into positions of power that actively harmed those below them. This was an evolutionarily favored trait which relied on the vast social diversity of Humans to leech from.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scientists who studied the effects of pollutants being introduced into their atmosphere often would warn these individuals in places of power about the imminent decomposition of the biosphere. Despite the obvious effects, a surprisingly large portion of the population actively denied the effects - including effects like significantly more powerful tropical storms that often destroyed the lives of these very deniers. This, coupled with skeptics and conspiracy theorists getting into positions of power, quickly drove the biosphere out of stability as they held zero regard for their actions beyond themselves and like-minded individuals.</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those that were able to escape were the scientists and engineers who were well aware of the effects before things got out of hand, and who were willing to try their chances in the stars once they realized their home was hopeless. While many good people died as a result of the careless actions of the few, including many of those that tried and failed to take this great journey. Thankfully, one of these communities was successful. Through countless years of adjustment and survival on their newly found world, through the course of hundreds of thousands of years, they were shaped and evolved into the Gaians.</p>"},{"location":"races/gaian/#romantic-and-bonding-interests","title":"Romantic and Bonding Interests","text":"<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gaians remain largey the same as most humans in this regard, with care for only one romantic partner being the most common type of relationship, with occasional instances of polyamory.

Most of the world's oceans and atmosphere were removed by solar winds, turning the planet into a desert comprised from the sand that was once the ocean floor. Plant life could not sustain itself under the harsh radiation of the star, and was quick to die, as were most animals that fed on the plants.
