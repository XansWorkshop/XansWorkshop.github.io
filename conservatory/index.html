                    <h1><em>Your journey began the moment you stepped foot within this universe...</em></h1>
                    <br/>
                    The Conservatory is a narrative-backed, voxel-based universal sandbox game. This is my "final boss", metaphorically speaking; it puts the last 15 years of indie development experience to the ultimate test.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    The Conservatory is not only an attempt to grow upon genres I like, but it's also a game for me personally. I want a way for the player to feel involved in the universe. I don't mean in the scope of <em>"your actions have meaning"</em> - that has been done for decades, that's just normal. Instead, I want the player to experience a level of wonder like you would get from going to a big city in person, exploring a new community center, travelling abroad... There's a certain sense of wonder, the kind you only get when you are experiencing a new world. <em>That's</em> the feeling I want to try to capture.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    You see, I want a world that <em>acknowledges who the player is</em>. But vitally, I don't want it to be all serious and bureaucratic. <em>We need to have fun.</em> If I'm going to have a space station, I want niche and borderline comical accommodations for random races. I want multilingual boards in alien languages and codeblocks for synthetics. I want the player to go in and be able to react to the locale, it shouldn't ever feel "normal" to them<br/>
